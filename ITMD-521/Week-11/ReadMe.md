# ITMD 521 Spring 2018

## Week 11 assignment

### Objectives 

* Install and configure industry standard VPN software 
* Configure and connect to industry standard VPN 
* Configure hadoop 2.6.5 installation to connect to a remote Hadoop cluster 
* Understand and analyze the effect of combiners on large MapReduce jobs

### Outcomes 

At the conclusion of this lab you will understand the reasons behind and be able to conenct to a remote network via a VPN.  You will have configured your Hadoop installation to connect to a remote cluster and will have run large scale jobs and analyzed the effect of Reducer classes upon the run time of the job.


### Part I

Assuming that you have succesfully installed, configured, and connected to the remote network via the VPN provided, you need to clone all of the configuration files (see note below) and properly configure you hadoop installation to connect to the remote Hadoop Cluster

Execute this command from your itmd521-cluster vagrant box ```hadoop fs -ls /user/controller/ncdc/1990/``` and take a screenshot of the output.  Place that image in **Deliverable 1** below. 

### Part II 

Compile the MaxTemperature sample code from the hadoop-book chapter 02.  Place the code into a jar file mt.jar (you may already have this step done, which in that case you can reuse mt.jar).  Run the command ```hadoop jar mt.jar MaxTemperature /user/controller/ncdc/YEAROFYOURBIRTH/YEAROFYOURBIRTH.txt``` and ```hadoop jar mt.jar MaxTemperatureWithCombiner /user/controller/ncdc/YEAROFYOURBIRTH/YEAROFYOURBIRTH.txt```

Repeat the above with this command:  ```hadoop jar mt.jar MaxTemperature /user/controller/ncdc/60-70/60-70.txt``` and ```hadoop jar mt.jar MaxTemperatureWithCombiner /user/controller/ncdc/60-70/60-70.txt```

Run each of these three times, capture a screenshot(s) of only these jobs (not others) include them in **Deliverable 2**   This will give you a total of 12 jobs

Note the execution time and graph all of the occurances (six job runs vs time to execute).  Place an image of that graph in **Deliverable 2**

### Part III

Using the textbook and the previous chapters, explain the effect of the reducer upon the outcomes of the job execution time from Part II in technical detail (It is faster or slower is not an acceptable answer).  Cite page sources from the book explaining how you arrived at your answer.

## Setup Remote Hadoop Cluster Notes

Copy all *.xml and .sh files into your ```~/hadoop-2.6.5/etc/hadoop``` directory overwritting the defaults 

Copy the hosts file content into your ```/etc/hosts file``` -- note ```/etc/hosts``` is owned by root so you need to use ```sudo```
